  Relay messages to your Batch.sh collections

# Resource: plumber_tunnel

A tunnel replay destination allows plumber to act as a relay for messages inside your infrastructure, avoiding the need to
punch holes in firewalls in order to replay messages to your message bus from Batch.sh.

This resource allows you to create/update/delete tunnel replay destination configurations.

## Example Usage

---

```hcl
resource "plumber_connection" "infra_kafka" {
  name = "local kafka on my infrastructure"
  kafka {
    address = ["10.1.80.253:9092"]
    connection_timeout = 5
  }
}

resource "plumber_tunnel" "my_replay_tunnel" {
  name = "Tunnel to infra kafka"
  
  # Obtained from your https://console.batch.sh account
  batchsh_api_token = "batchsh_....."

  connection_id = plumber_connection.infra_kafka.id

  kafka {
    topics = ["new_orders"]
    headers = {
      replayed = "true"
      additional = "some additional val"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference
